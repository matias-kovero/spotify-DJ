# Spotify DJ (Seamless Playback)
> This was a small project while learning React, thus the code has bunch of mistakes & no structure.  
If you are here looking for Spotify SDK solutions, you should check my [svelte package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-spotify-web-playback).  
I highly suggest using it over this one, as this repo is an mess.  
Small player made with the package: [here](https://github.com/matias-kovero/Spotify-Gameboy)

Just an Spotify Web Player using **Web Playback SDK**.  
Audio Analysis done with **Spotify Web API**.


Live Demo found [here](https://spotify-dj.vercel.app)  
Web SDK currently works only for **premiums users**. _(Spotify restrictions)_
