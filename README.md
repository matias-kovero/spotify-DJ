# A custom Spotify web client suited for automotive use
A Spotify Web Player using **Web Playback SDK**. Original project developed by [Matias Kovero](https://github.com/matias-kovero).

I have modified it in this fork and made it better suited for use in my personal project. My project includes a 1024 x 600px LCD screen and in the future also a Raspberry Pi probably. It will run Spotify Web Client and it will have buttons for pause/play, next track and previous track. The LCD and Raspberry will be mounted on the dashboard of my 1999 Saab 9-3.
